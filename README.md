# Summer School
During the break for 3 weeks I went to summer school. Summer school was from 8:30 to 2:30. For the 2 periods I only had PE. This was because I didn't want to take PE so I took 2 semester of PE. This meant that i had about 4 hours of PE every single day for 3 weeks straight. For the first couple of days it was boring but as the more frequent I come the more activities we do. I would usually play a volleyball game for 1st period then play basketball for 2nd period. It was nice to be able to see some familiar faces and keep in touch with them over the summer. I also met some new people who informed me about other classes and gave me some notes for them. It was a really nice experience.

Martial Arts
===============
I only recenty have started to do some form of martial arts. I used to do taekwondo at my elementary school but never got to the next belt. I wasn't really into martial arts but more in music. After I "retired" from playing music, I decided that I want to give martial arts 1 more chance

Juijitsu
---------------
I was first introduced to Juijitsu through my father. He studied Judo in highschool-college and is a back belt. He told me a little bit about juijitsu and how its a combination of Judo and other martial arts. I started 2 weeks before school ended and now been training with Pat (instructor) for little over 3 months. My first time participating in his class was very nice and welcoming. His teaching were mostly based on self defense but we did lots of technical skills. He made me fall in love with Juijitsu and continue to.

 

Kickboxing
---------------
Before chosing Juijistu, I really wanted to some sort of boxing. Ever since I was young I still remembering the scene in the movie Rock where Rocky(Sylvester Stallone
) was about to lose to Apollo (Carl Weathers) then he suddenly stood back up and started to fight. That really took a huge impact to the way how I think. It made my life change. So I thought Boxing would be perfect, but these boxing gyms cost so much and I also had to buy a bunch of training gear. We then looked into Muay Thai (thai kickboxing) and I was hooked in. Though my father didn't really agree because the gym we checked about was more focused on fighting events. He didn't want me to do martial arts just to fight people but to build discipline, respect, and body movement. After finding a juijitsu gym they also taught kickboxing. It was perfect because it was before my juijitsu class. At first it was pretty difficult but the more I went the easier it got. 

Family
===============
I was able to spend more time with my family and especially my grandmother. My grandmother and me have a strong language barrier so its reallt hard to comunicate with her. We also beleive she's starting to have alzheimers. After my grandfathers passing my grandmother hasn't been the same. She became severly depressed and was constantly talking about suicide. Even though she was talking about suicide she was a devote christian and new that she could never commit suicide. My grandmother is a very "square" type of person so she and my dad don't get along with each other. Before my grandfathers passing, he was the the person to keep balance. Now since we didn't have school, my mom wanted to visit her more often. She later started to go to a day care and spend time with other elders. She became more happy. I think that genuinely summer truly saved my grandmother to live in tears and regret. It also made me realize how much of an impact of someones death can do to the people around them.
